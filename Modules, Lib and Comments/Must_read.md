So, the codes I provided you are the codes to help you guys getting started with python basically.Some of them are the codes which are basically showcasing how to import any lib and then use it but I won't recommend you guys using and importing lib at the beginning of your learning journey. Why I did this in the very first chapter is cause so that you guys learn how you guys can import any lib in python. You guess just need to " pip install lib_name" in terminal and it will install the desired lib in your local machine. Other purpose of me writing the library consisting code was to make you guys make the use of AI. I want you guys to put my code in AI like chatgpt or github copilot or perplexity and ask them to teach you the purpose of each line as these tools make your learning so easy. So, basically this is all for now. See you guys.
